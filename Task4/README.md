# Task 4 - Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation

# Objective

This project demonstrates the implementation of complex form validation and dynamic DOM manipulation. It includes:
- Validating form fields (email and password).
- Displaying error messages and success messages based on form submission.
- Dynamically updating the DOM with the form submission results.

The project also showcases the ability to handle form validation with custom rules, such as validating the password strength.

# Features
- Email and Password Validation: 
  - Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain both letters and numbers.
  - Email validation to ensure the input is in a valid format.

- Dynamic DOM Updates: 
  - Shows error messages for invalid input.
  - Displays a success message when the form is submitted correctly.

# Technologies Used
- React: For building the user interface.
- CSS: For styling the components.
- JavaScript: For form validation and dynamic DOM manipulation.
